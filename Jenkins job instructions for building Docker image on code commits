1) I will sign into my account and access jenkins dashboard.

2) I will click on manage jenkins and then click on plugins.

3) In the Installed plugins I will check the installation of the required plugins [Docker Pipeline Plugin, Git Plugin].

4) If I do not find them I will go to the Available plugins, Search for the missing plugin and install it from the checkbox.

5) I will restart jenkins after the installation process finished.

6) I will make sure that they are installed in the Installed plugins.



7) I will create a New Jenkins Job:

- Go to Jenkins dashboard and click on "New Item".
Enter a name for your job and select "Pipeline" as the job type.
Configure Pipeline:

In the pipeline section, select "Pipeline script from SCM".
Choose Git as the SCM.
Enter the repository URL.
Set the branch specifier to monitor for changes.
Define Pipeline Script:

Write a Jenkinsfile in your repository's root directory.
Example Jenkinsfile:
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build('your_image_name:latest')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Make sure Jenkins has access to Docker:
Install Docker on the Jenkins server.
Ensure the Jenkins user has permissions to run Docker commands.
Save your Jenkins job configuration and run.
